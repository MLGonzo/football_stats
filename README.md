Welcome!

If you'd like to make predictions using the Dixon-Coles model, then the notebook you'll need to run is `predict_with_dc.ipynb`.

If you're after creating your own DC backed dataset you can play with - then you'll want to run the code in `validate_dc.ipynb`. 
The single dataframe code in that notebook will give you a flavour for what the predictions do, but you'll want to run the multiprocess code
to be able to make a large dataset within any reasonable timeframe.
